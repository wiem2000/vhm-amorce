# Medical Parameter Management Project

This medical parameter management project was developed as part of my internship at Dapsys VisionHM. The primary goal of this project has now shifted to developing a robust and user-friendly web application that will enable healthcare institutions to efficiently manage medical parameters, track patient-related data, and facilitate data-driven decision-making. This project aims to contribute to overall healthcare quality improvement by providing a modern solution for medical data management.

## Features

- Management of medical parameters, including classes, subclasses, types...
- Dynamic dashboards representing medical services and their parameters.
- Integration with a MySQL database for data storage.
- User-friendly interface developed using Angular and Bootstrap.
