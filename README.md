# Medical Parameter Management Project

This medical parameter management project was developed as part of my internship at Dapsys VisionHM. The primary goal of this project has now shifted to developing a robust and user-friendly web application that will enable healthcare institutions to efficiently manage medical parameters, track patient-related data, and facilitate data-driven decision-making. This project aims to contribute to overall healthcare quality improvement by providing a modern solution for medical data management.

## Features

- Management of medical parameters, including classes, subclasses, types...
- Dynamic dashboards representing medical services and their parameters.
- Integration with a MySQL database for data storage.
- User-friendly interface developed using Angular and Bootstrap.

## How to Use This Project

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) installed
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database set up
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) 
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/):  installed: The mvn command is used for dependency management and building the Spring Boot project.

### Installation

1. Clone this GitHub repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wiem2000/vhm-amorce.git
```
### Front-End (Angular)
1.Navigate to the front-end directory:

```shell
cd vhm-amorce/vhm-amorce-frontend

```

2.Install the necessary dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

2.Start the development server:

```shell
ng serve
```


The front-end should now be accessible at http://localhost:4200/.

### Back-End (Spring Boot)
1.Navigate to the back-end directory:

```shell
cd vhm-amorce/vhm_amorce_backend
```

2.Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Spring Tool Suite).

3.Start the Spring Boot application.

or 

1.Navigate to the back-end directory
```shell
cd vhm-amorce/vhm_amorce_backend
```
2.build the spribg boot project
```shell
mvn package
```
3.run the application  ( JAR file generated by Maven)
```shell
java -jar vhm_amorce_backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The backend should now be accessible at http://localhost:8080/

###Usage

- Back-End: The Spring Boot back-end provides the necessary APIs for the front-end. It handles data storage and retrieval from the MySQL database.
- Front-End: Access the web application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:4200/ and explore the user-friendly interface to manage the application's features.
